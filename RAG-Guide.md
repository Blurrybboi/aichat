RAG can improve the efficacy of large language model (LLM) applications by leveraging custom data

AICHAT has a built-in vector database and full-text search engine, eliminating reliance on third-party services and  providing ready-to-use RAG functionality.

## Init RAG

**From Files**

```
> Add documents: /tmp/dir1/file1;/tmp/dir1/file2
Loading /tmp/dir1/file1 [1/2]
Loading /tmp/dir1/file2 [2/2]
```

**From Directory**

```
> Add documents: /tmp/dir1/
Load /tmp/dir1/ [1/1]
🚀 Loading file /tmp/dir1/file1
🚀 Loading file /tmp/dir1/file2
🚀 Loading file /tmp/dir1/file3
✨ Load directory completed
```

**From Directory (with file extensions filter)**

```
> Add documents: /tmp/dir2/**/*.{md,txt}
Load /tmp/dir2/**/*.{md,txt} [1/1]
🚀 Loading file /tmp/dir2/file2.md
🚀 Loading file /tmp/dir2/file1.txt
✨ Load directory completed
```
> AIChat RAG doesn't support glob; it only uses glob syntax for filtering file extensions.

**From Url**

```
> Add documents: https://sigoden.github.io/mynotes/tools/linux.html
Load https://sigoden.github.io/mynotes/tools/linux.html [1/1]
```

**From RecursiveUrl (websites)**

```
> Add documents: https://sigoden.github.io/mynotes/tools/**
Load https://sigoden.github.io/mynotes/tools/** [1/1]

## Custom Document Loaders

By default, AICHAT can only process text files. We need to configure the `document_loaders` so AICHAT can handle binary files such as PDFs and DOCXs.

```yaml
# Define document loaders to control how RAG and `.file`/`--file` load files of specific formats.
document_loaders:
  # You can add custom loaders using the following syntax:
  #   <file-extension>: <command-to-load-the-file>
  # Note: Use `$1` for input file and `$2` for output file. If `$2` is omitted, use stdout as output.
  pdf: 'pdftotext $1 -'                         # Load .pdf file, see https://poppler.freedesktop.org to set up pdftotext
  docx: 'pandoc --to plain $1'                  # Load .docx file, see https://pandoc.org to set up pandoc
```

The `document_loaders` configuration item is a map where the key represents the file extension and the value specifies the corresponding loader command.

To ensure the loaders function correctly, please verify that the required tools are installed.

## Use Reranker

AIChat RAG defaults to the `reciprocal_rank_fusion` algorithm for merging vector and keyword search results.

However, using a reranker to combine these results is a more established method that can yield greater relevance and accuracy.

You can add the following configuration to specify the default reranker.

```yaml
rag_reranker_model: null                    # Specifies the rerank model to use
```

You can also dynamically adjust the reranker using the `.set` command.

```
.set rag_reranker_model <tab>
```
